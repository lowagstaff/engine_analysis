## Overview

**Project Title**: Automotive Analysis

**Project Description**: A program that analyzes automotive engine data to determine if pressures and temperatures have an effect on engine condition and/or performance.

**Project Goals**: To understand more about Python data analysis libraries like pandas, numby, and matplot. Specifically understanding how this sprint can apply to my future careers. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the file (make note of the csv file)
2. Open the dataanalysis.py file and make sure the df = pd.read_csv("csv file") is reading the correct name for the csv file.
3. Pressing play should just start the program, visual charts are best displayed in full screen mode. 

Instructions for using the software:

1. So far, just press play and scroll through the data in the terminal. 
2. Visual charts will display, make sure to use full-screen mode to make it easier to read. Exit charts to keep progressing
3. Throughout each dataset, you will be asked thinking questions, an input question will appear, just press enter to continue the program. 

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VSCode
* Libraries: numpy; pandas; matplotlib.pyplot;
* Make sure to have the CSV file. (should be in the folder)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Youtube: A Gentle Introduction to Pandas Data Analysis (on Kaggle)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Eb0utIRdkw)
* [StackOverflow: Dataframe set_index not setting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42196337/dataframe-set-index-not-setting)
* [Chart visualization](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Really learn how to use the charts and make them look more professional. 
* [ ] Adding values to the charts to make it more easy to understand when charts are close in size.
* [ ] More equations and factors for analysis to get more in depth answers.
